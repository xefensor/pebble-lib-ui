# Developing XOCE Pebble UI

## Select the development environment

This checkout selects **Node 22.23.4** in `.node-version` and **Python 3.12.15** in
`.python-version`; CI reads those same files. A Node version manager that reads
`.node-version` can select it automatically. With fnm and uv already installed:

```sh
fnm use --install-if-missing
uv venv --python "$(cat .python-version)" .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
npm run check:setup
```

The setup check reports missing or mismatched runtimes and installs nothing.
The virtual environment stays in ignored `.venv/`. Install locked dependencies
with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` after selecting the runtimes.


Use Node 22, Python 3.12 and a C99 compiler (`cc`, or set `CC`). Portable tests do not need a
phone, watch or Pebble SDK. For native SDK builds install [Pebble SDK
4.33.1](https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/) and make `pebble` available on PATH. This
repository builds independently from its own committed dependencies.

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm run build
npm run pack:candidate
```

`npm test` runs source/native, workflow, release-fixture and documentation checks. CI uses Node
22 and Python 3.12; it does not claim SDK, emulator or physical-device coverage.

`src/c` and `include` own drawing helpers and measurements; `src/js/settings-style.js` owns the
shared phone CSS. Apps retain all lifecycle, input, state and controller ownership.

## Outputs and evidence

Active source lives in the directories above. Generated SDK and npm packages live in ignored
`build/candidate/`. Disposable QA belongs in `build/qa/`. Candidate checks reject changed source
or altered build outputs. Frozen `dist/`, `releases/` and root `dist.zip` belong to their
original release tags. Existing `docs/qa/` records and images are historical evidence; do not
overwrite or relabel them.

For visual changes, inspect the consuming app in the emulator; portable tests establish no
visual/device claim. Report source tests, packaged audits, emulator runs and real-device tests
separately.

## Release commands

`npm run release:prepare` validates committed frozen inputs and writes `build/release/`. It
never builds or publishes. `npm run release:publish` is restricted to the manually dispatched
GitHub release workflow on main. See [RELEASING](docs/RELEASING.md) for freezing a new version
and safe reruns. Finish authorized work in reviewable local commits; pushing or publication
needs explicit scope.

[History index](docs/history/index.md).

`python3 scripts/check-consumers.py` is an optional workspace audit that expects the four
sibling apps. It is not part of building, testing, packaging or releasing this library;
standalone checkouts need no sibling repositories.
